About this project:

This project is an inspiration from E1, E2, and E3 of Sebastian Lague on YouTube, with my teammate Mohamed Moumou.
We reproduced the pathfinding and experienced different search and 
heuristic strategies. First, following the instructions of the A* (video heuristic) we got to 
simulate the 5 other algorithms, A* Euclidian distance, A* Manhattan distance, BFS, DFS, 
and UCS. As stated previously, we got to analyze each algorithm by printing its fringe, fringe 
length, expanded nodes, expanded nodes length, the path length, and time. These parameters 
helped us to compare between each algorithm. So far, we got the appropriate simulation of all 
algorithms and relying on the previous parameters we could reach to the project goal by 
understanding the algorithm behind each strategy and use the parameters to check whether 
our algorithm is working well or not.
